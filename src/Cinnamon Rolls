# Cinnamon Rolls

*   Prep Time: 80 minutes
*   Cook Time: 20-30 minutes
*   Servings: About 16

### Ingredients

*   1.5 cups warm water
*   2 tsp sugar
*   4.5 tsp yeast (regular or instant)
*   2 tsp salt
*   1/4 cup sugar
*   1/4 cup vegetable oil
*   4 cups flour
*   Vegetable shortening for rolls
*   Sugar for rolls
*   Cinnamon for rolls

### Directions

1.  Combine warm water, 2 tsp sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Stir together and let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  After 10 minutes the yeast should be foaming. If it is not, something has gone wrong and you should try again. Mix in 2 tsp salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.
3.  Slowly mix in the flour. Knead with your hands or a dough hook a few times.
4.  Cover dough with a wet paper towel and allow it to rise for 1 hour, or 30 minutes if you have used instant or quick rising yeast.
5.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and pour some oil in the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan.
6.  Turn dough onto a clean surface for rolling, such as a very clean table or countertop, a rolling mat, or parchment paper.
7.  Use some of the oil in the baking pan to oil a rolling pin so the dough doesn't stick to it. Roll out dough until it is reasonably thin.
8.  Spread vegetable shortening all over the dough. Sprinkle a generous amount of sugar and cinnamon on top. Roll dough into a log, or it is easier to do two logs. Cut each log into pieces.
9.  Transfer cinnamon rolls to oiled baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until they are slightly brown on top. Enjoy!
