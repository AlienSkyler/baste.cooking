<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
<li>2 tsp sugar</li>
<li>4.5 tsp yeast (regular or instant)</li>
<li>2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Combine warm water, 2 tsp sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Stir together and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes the yeast should be foaming. If it is not, something has gone wrong and you should try again. Mix in 2 tsp salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.</li>
<li>Slowly mix in the flour. Knead with your hands or a dough hook a few times.</li>
<li>Cover dough with a wet paper towel and allow it to rise for 1 hour, or 30 minutes if you have used instant or quick rising yeast.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and pour some oil in the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan.</li>
<li>Turn dough onto a clean surface for rolling, such as a very clean table or countertop, a rolling mat, or parchment paper.</li>
<li>Use some of the oil in the baking pan to oil a rolling pin so the dough doesn't stick to it. Roll out dough until it is reasonably thin.</li>
<li>Spread vegetable shortening all over the dough. Sprinkle a generous amount of sugar and cinnamon on top. Roll dough into a log, or it is easier to do two logs. Cut each log into pieces.</li>
<li>Transfer cinnamon rolls to oiled baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until they are slightly brown on top. Enjoy!</li>
